/// are always None until the first second-level update occurs). When the two-level behavior is enabled,
/// in all methods where a field name has to be supplied, the following convention should be followed:
///
/// - The field name can always be used, both for the first-level and the second-level fields. In case of
///   name conflict, the first-level field is meant.
/// - The field position can always be used; however, the field positions for the second-level fields start
///   at the highest position of the first-level field list + 1. If a field schema had been specified for
///   either first-level or second-level Subscriptions, then client-side knowledge of the first-level schema
///   length would be required.
